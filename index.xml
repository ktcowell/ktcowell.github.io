      <description>Nearing the end of an abysmal 2021-2022 athletics season, Huskers fans should be entitled to financial compensation for pain and suffering.
Unless you live under a rock, it’s no secret that Nebraska football, baseball and men’s basketball have not performed well this year.

There were $18.5 million reasons for him to stay, but public pressure and a not so pretty track record led to a restructured contract that reduced Hoiberg’s buyout to only $11 million.</description>
